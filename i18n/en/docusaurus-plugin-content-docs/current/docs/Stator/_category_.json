    "description": "The stator in electrical machines is a stationary part that holds the windings providing the armature field. It is crucial for the operation of motors and generators, as it interacts with the rotor to produce torque or generate electricity. In eMotorSolution, the Stator milestone is comprised of three checkpoints: Slot, Lamination and Winding."
