# Laminations Checkpoint
The rotor core properties are defined in this checkpoint. The following properties are defined:
- **Fill Factor**: The fill factor of the rotor core. The fill factor is the ratio of the area occupied by the laminations to the total area of the rotor core. It is a dimensionless quantity between 0 and 1.
- **Lamination Material**: The material of the rotor core. The material is selected from the available material list. This available material list is defined in the `Material` checkpoint.

:::info
The stack length of rotor core is assumed to be equal to the stack length of the stator core.
