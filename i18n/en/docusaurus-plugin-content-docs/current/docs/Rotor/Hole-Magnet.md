# Hole-Magnet Checkpoint
This type of checkpoint appears in the rotor milestone if the machine type is **IPMSM**. This type of machine may have multiple set of magnet-hole pairs. And each set of magnet-hole pairs has its own independent geometrical and material properties. 

To add a new set of magnet-hole pairs, click on the **Add Hole-Magnet** button in the property editor panel or right-click on the **Hole-Magnet** checkpoint in the project tree and select **Add Hole-Magnet** from the context menu.

Each section contains <span style={{ fontFamily: 'Segoe Fluent Icons', fontSize: '1.0em' }}>&#xE9CE;</span> button to preview the hole-magnet pair shape, and <span style={{ fontFamily: 'Segoe Fluent Icons', fontSize: '1.0em' }}>&#xEC5B;</span> button to print the hint values in the log panel and <span style={{ fontFamily: 'Segoe Fluent Icons', fontSize: '1.0em' }}>&#xE74D;</span> button to delete that hole-magnet pair.
