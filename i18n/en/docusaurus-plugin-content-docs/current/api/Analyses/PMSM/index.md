For Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSM), whether they are surface-mounted (SPMSM) or interior (IPMSM), the following analyses are available:
| Analysis Name | Description |
|---|---|
| [`PMSM_Back_EMF`](/docs/api/Analyses/PMSM/PMSM_Back_EMF) | Calculates the back electromotive force (EMF) of the PMSM based on its design and operating conditions. |
| [`PMSM_Transient`](/docs/api/Analyses/PMSM/PMSM_Transient) | Calculates the transient response of the PMSM based on initial conditions and operating parameters. |
| [`PMSM_Static`](/docs/api/Analyses/PMSM/PMSM_Static) | Calculates the static response of the PMSM based on initial conditions and operating parameters. |
