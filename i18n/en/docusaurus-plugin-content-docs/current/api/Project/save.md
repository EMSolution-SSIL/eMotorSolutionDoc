# save
The `save` method of the `Project` class is used to save the current project to the [`Project.path`](/docs/api/Project/index.md) file. This method ensures that all modifications made to the project are persisted to disk, allowing for later retrieval and analysis.

## Syntax
```python
Project.save()
```


## Example Usage
TODO: Add an example of how to save a project.
