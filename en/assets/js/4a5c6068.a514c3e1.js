The magnetization direction is the direction of the magnetic field lines, while the strength is the magnitude of the magnetic field. The strength of a magnet can be measured in Tesla (T) or Gauss (G), with 1 T = 10,000 G. The relative permeability of a magnet is a measure of how easily it can be magnetized in the presence of an external magnetic field. The relative permeability is defined as the ratio of the magnetic field strength inside the material to the magnetic field strength outside the material. It is possible to take the conductivty of the magnet into account to calculate the ohmic losses in the magnet.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/Materials/Non-Magnet":{"id":"docs/Materials/Non-Magnet","title":"Non-Magnet","description":"The non-magnet material refers to materials such as conducting materials in windings, core materials on the staor and rotor, air, vaccuum, etc.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"docs/mesh":{"id":"docs/mesh","title":"Mesh","description":"The mesh properties are defined in this checkpoint.
